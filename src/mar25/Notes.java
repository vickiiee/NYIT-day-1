		 * Exception Handling:
		 * 		try/catch blocks for exceptions

		 * 		great for testing
		 * 		if exception is thrown, put that into the catch block parameters to 'catch' it
		 * 
		 * 	Can use multiple catch statements for several exceptions after try block

		 *      
		 *      Can be used to determine if something is there or not, kinda like if/else 
		 *      
		 *  EX: determine int or string:
		 *      scanner;
		 *      int num; //to store user input
		 *      try{
		 * 			num = scanner.nextLine()n;
		 *
